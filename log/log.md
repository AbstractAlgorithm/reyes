This log serves a purpose of reminding myself of some of the problems that I faced, frustrations that kept wake at night and how I handled/managed them. Log wasn't started immediately as the project did, but it's late a few days.

First rendered image.

I will also soon discuss some of the issues that I came along during the initial effort to build a pipeline, new realizations and problems that weren't initially planned. Yet, I'm pretty happy to see the thing displayed, even though it was a master cheat to get that image. Image is actually 10x10, there is practically no camera, no projection, no bound-split, not even a real dicing. No shaders. Only quarter of parallel quadrilateral (blue) is visible. I said it was a cheat. :D

So, v1.0 us out. I've modified goals in a readme.

***on inverse interpolation:*** While I was thinking about rasterization, I needed some way of getting interpolated attributes for a given point in space. So this is the problem: the primitive is ignorant of the rasterization that will happen on it. And the Image is responsible for generating samples (some Image might generate only one sample, while anti-aliased buffers will try to generate many samples). In conclusion, it is the Image that will generate sample points, and therefore I need some way of getting a color for a generated sample. So, I need piece of code that will input a Primitive (or a Shape that is made of bunch of Primitives) and a sample point (location), and the output would be a color of the Primitive at that location (interpolated value). I currently plan three basic Primitives: quadrilaterals, triangles and polygons. So for each of those, I need inverse interpolation function. [Shadertoy - quadrilateral interpolation](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ldt3Wr) is the toy that I made, with my own version of the method (which is wrong and introduces UV seams), but later got corrected by Inigo Quilez how to do it properly. Entire code is on the Shadertoy. So, quadrilaterals are good. I also found [inverse barycentric](http://ofekshilon.com/2013/01/21/geometric-inverse-application-1-barycentric-coordinates/) article. I'll throw another Shadertoy example soon ([inverse barycentric](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4d3GDH).
